Help Kathy figure out how much coffee to drink



On a drowsy Monday morning,Kathy is slightly relieved during her coffee break,and wants to gulp down as many cups of her favourite cuppa as possible.Kathy can only
 get coffee from the coffee machine at the food-court,and it takes T minutes for her to walk to the food-court from her cubicle(and another T minutes to get back).
 She is particular about drinking her coffee only in the comfort of her cubicle and does not make any stops on the way to or from the coffee machine.
 Every cup of coffee that she drinks gives her more energy and cuts the time she takes to get to the coffee machine by B minutes.
 However the coffee buzz factor has a saturation point,the minimum time required for a one way trip must be at least 1 minute.
 If her coffee break lasts for N minutes and if Kathy won't attempt a trip that will exceed her stipulated break time,
 find the max no of cups she could drink within the time period.
